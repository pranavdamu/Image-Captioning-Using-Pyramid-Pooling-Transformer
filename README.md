# Image-Captioning-Using-Pyramid-Pooling-Transformer
 Image captioning bridges computer vision and NLP to generate image descriptions. Using Pyramid Pooling Transformer on the Flickr8k dataset, we enhanced multi-scale feature representation by integrating Pyramid Pooling Modules with a Transformer encoder. Achieving a BLEU score of 34.89, our model showed competitive performance and efficiency.
